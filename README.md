ICT251: Single-File Web App - Quadratic Solver and Grade Converter  
This repository contains a single-file web application (index.html) built using HTML and JavaScript to fulfill the ICT251 assignment requirements.  
It provides two main functions:
Quadratic Equation Solver: Calculates the discriminant, determines the nature of the roots, and solves the equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0. It includes validation to ensure a \ne 0 and that all inputs are numbers.  
Grade Converter: Converts a numeric score (0-100) to a letter grade based on the defined scale.
